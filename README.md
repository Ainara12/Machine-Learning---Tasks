# Machine-Learning---Tasks

## Introduction

I have created this repository for the Machine Learning module tasks. 
Please find below the full details of what needs to be done for every task. 

## Instructions: 
### Contents of this repository
* **Drafts folder**,that I keep coming back and find possible new solutions to tasks or practice examples there.
* **Machine Learning-Tasks folder**
* .gitignore
* README file

The four tasks are included inside the folder titled **'Machine Learning-Tasks'**, this folder includes:

* The **main Jupyter notebook** which includes the 4 tasks along with references and explanations for my code and my thought process.
* **Images & documents folder**, including any images that I have used in my main Task notebook or the drafts.

## Main Jupyter Notebook including the tasks to be evaluated: 

The Jupyter notebook titled: MACHINE LEARNING MODULE TASKS 2020, includes the tasks.
In order to navigate through it just follow the instructions in markdown cells within the document. 
I have also included comments to my code in areas that I considered needed explanation or more detail.


## Task listed:

### Task 1

1. October 5th, 2020: Write a Python function called sqrt2 that calculates and
prints to the screen the square root of 2 to 100 decimal places. Your code should
not depend on any module from the standard library1 or otherwise. You should
research the task first and include references and a description of your algorithm.

### Task 2

2. November 2nd, 2020: The Chi-squared test for independence is a statistical
hypothesis test like a t-test. It is used to analyse whether two categorical variables
are independent. The Wikipedia article gives the table below as an example [4],
stating the Chi-squared value based on it is approximately 24.6. Use scipy.stats
to verify this value and calculate the associated p value. You should include a short
note with references justifying your analysis in a markdown cell.


### Task 3

3. November 16th, 2020: The standard deviation of an array of numbers x is
calculated using numpy as np.sqrt(np.sum((x - np.mean(x))**2)/len(x)) .
However, Microsoft Excel has two different versions of the standard deviation
calculation, STDEV.P and STDEV.S . The STDEV.P function performs the above
calculation but in the STDEV.S calculation the division is by len(x)-1 rather
than len(x) . Research these Excel functions, writing a note in a Markdown cell
about the difference between them. Then use numpy to perform a simulation
demonstrating that the STDEV.S calculation is a better estimate for the standard
deviation of a population when performed on a sample. Note that part of this task
is to figure out the terminology in the previous sentence.

### Task 4

4. November 30th, 2020: Use scikit-learn to apply k-means clustering to
Fisherâ€™s famous Iris data set. You will easily obtain a copy of the data set online. Explain in a Markdown cell how your code works and how accurate it might
be, and then explain how your model could be used to make predictions of species
of iris.
